# 📘 Rainy Agents - User Guide

**Version**: 1.0
**Last Updated**: 2025-11-16
**Target Audience**: Rainy Code IDE Users

---

## 🎯 Introduction

Welcome to **Rainy Agents**, the multi-agent AI system powering Rainy Code IDE! This guide will help you understand and effectively use our AI agents to enhance your development workflow.

### What are Rainy Agents?

Rainy Agents is a sophisticated multi-agent system that provides specialized AI assistance for different development tasks. Instead of a one-size-fits-all AI, you get access to multiple specialized agents, each optimized for specific workflows.

### Available Agents

Currently, Rainy Code includes **two specialized agents**:

1. **Rainy** - General-purpose coding assistant
2. **Claude Code** - Code analysis and refactoring specialist

---

## 💡 Best Practices

### Choosing the Right Agent

**Use Rainy when**:
- You need quick answers or simple code generation
- You're exploring the codebase
- You want to execute commands or manage files
- You need a general-purpose assistant

**Use Claude Code when**:
- You want detailed code analysis
- You're refactoring complex code
- You need test generation
- You're debugging tricky issues
- You want architecture or security review

### Writing Effective Prompts

**Good Prompts**:
- ✅ "Analyze src/auth.ts for security vulnerabilities"
- ✅ "Refactor the UserService class to use dependency injection"
- ✅ "Generate unit tests for the validation utility functions"
- ✅ "Find all files that import the User model"

**Less Effective Prompts**:
- ❌ "Fix my code" (too vague)
- ❌ "Make it better" (unclear goals)
- ❌ "Help" (no context)

**Tips for Better Results**:
1. **Be Specific**: Mention file names, line numbers, or specific issues
2. **Provide Context**: Explain what you're trying to achieve
3. **Ask Follow-ups**: If the response isn't perfect, ask for clarification
4. **Use Examples**: Show the agent what you're looking for

---

## ⚡ Agent Modes

Both agents support **dual-mode operation**:

### Fast Mode (🚀)

- **Speed**: < 200ms responses
- **How it works**: Direct execution via Rust backend
- **Best for**: Simple queries, file reads, quick commands
- **Trade-off**: Less reasoning, simpler responses

**Example**: "List all TypeScript files in src/"

### Smart Mode (🧠)

- **Speed**: < 500ms responses
- **How it works**: LangGraph ReAct pattern with advanced reasoning
- **Best for**: Complex tasks, multi-step operations, code analysis
- **Trade-off**: Slightly slower but much more intelligent

**Example**: "Refactor this code to improve performance and maintainability"

### Auto Mode (🤖)

**Both agents automatically choose the best mode** based on your message:

- **Rainy**: Defaults to fast mode for simple queries, smart mode for complex tasks
- **Claude Code**: Defaults to smart mode (analysis benefits from reasoning)

**You can override** by explicitly requesting:
- "Quick mode: List files" → Forces fast mode
- "Detailed analysis: Review this code" → Forces smart mode

## 🛠️ Tool Execution

When agents work, they use **Rust-backed tools** for various operations:

### Available Tools

| Tool | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `read_file` | Read file contents | Reading source code |
| `write_file` | Create/update files | Saving generated code |
| `list_directory` | List directory contents | Exploring project structure |
| `execute_command` | Run terminal commands | Running tests, building |
| `git_status` | Check Git status | Before committing changes |
| `git_log` | View commit history | Understanding recent changes |
| `workspace_structure` | Analyze workspace | Understanding architecture |
| `search_files` | Search for patterns | Finding references |

### Watching Tool Execution

The UI shows **real-time tool execution**:

- **Pending** ⏳: Tool queued for execution
- **Running** 🔄: Tool currently executing
- **Success** ✅: Tool completed successfully
- **Error** ❌: Tool encountered an error

Click on any tool execution to see **detailed results**:
- Input parameters
- Output/result
- Execution time
- Error messages (if any)

3. Claude Code will:
   - Read the file
   - Analyze code quality
   - Identify potential bugs
   - Suggest improvements
4. Follow up with: "Generate tests for the issues you found"

**Result**: Thorough review + test generation

---

### Workflow 2: Feature Implementation

**Goal**: Add a new feature with tests

**Steps**:
1. Select **Rainy** agent
2. Message: "Create a user authentication module with JWT"
3. Rainy will:
   - Generate the module code
   - Create necessary files
   - Explain the implementation
4. Switch to **Claude Code**
5. Message: "Generate comprehensive tests for the auth module"

**Result**: Complete feature with tests

---

### Workflow 3: Debugging

**Steps**:
1. Select **Claude Code** agent
2. Message: "Debug why the login function sometimes fails"
3. Claude Code will:
   - Read relevant files
   - Analyze execution flow
   - Identify potential race conditions or edge cases
   - Suggest fixes with explanations
4. Follow up: "Implement your suggested fix"

**Result**: Bug identified and fixed with explanation

## 🎓 Tips and Tricks

### Tip 1: Chain Conversations

Agents remember context within a session:

```
You: "Read src/config.ts"
Agent: [Reads file and shows content]

You: "Now update the database URL"
Agent: [Updates the file, remembering the context]
```

### Tip 2: Be Specific About Files

Good:
- "Analyze src/services/auth.ts"
- "Refactor components/UserProfile.tsx"

Less Good:
- "Look at the auth file" (which one?)
- "Fix the component" (which component?)

### Tip 3: Use Multi-Step Requests

Both agents handle complex multi-step tasks:

```
"1. Read all files in src/utils
 2. Find duplicated code
 3. Suggest how to extract it into shared functions"
```

### Tip 4: Ask for Explanations

Don't just get code - understand it:

```
"Explain why you chose this approach"
"What are the trade-offs of this solution?"
"How does this compare to [alternative approach]?"
```

### Tip 5: Leverage Agent Strengths

- **Quick lookups**: Use Rainy (fast mode)
- **Deep analysis**: Use Claude Code (smart mode)
- **File operations**: Both work great
- **Code generation**: Start with Rainy, review with Claude Code
