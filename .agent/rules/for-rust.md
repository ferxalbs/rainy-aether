Whenever modifications, alterations, improvements, or other changes are made, you must use Rust as a robust backend, as this will help us to be faster, more accurate, and more functional. Whenever Rust is implemented, you must not leave anything unused, and anything that is not used must be removed. There should be no dead code or unused code; it's all or nothing. 

Let me give you a practical example. Let's say we are going to improve the agent system. Your immediate thought might be to edit everything in TS, design, and more, but you should not go down that easy path. Instead, you should go to the core, which is in Rust, where the real difference between the ordinary and the robust and exceptional lies. At the same time, this project is a Tauri 2. It's not for nothing that we're building a Tauri IDE to compete with the big players and go our own way in the technology sector.
