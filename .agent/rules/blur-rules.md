Whenever we start making changes to include blur on elements, we will use this configuration: bg-background/10 backdrop-blur-3xl to maintain consistency throughout the IDE and the project in general, which will help us maintain order and clarity. And if necesary and use the element: backdrop-saturate-150 for a richer glass effect.
